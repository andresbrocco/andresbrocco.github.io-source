The [Formula Student/SAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_SAE) is an international competition where students design, build and compete with a 'mini formula 1' car. It is the biggest engineering student competition, gathering more than 600 teams from all over the world.

During my 5-year participation at the UNICAMP Team, I had the oportunity to compete in 4 national competitions (Brazil) and 2 international competitions (Lincoln and Michigan - USA), presenting the project to several honorable names from the automotive industry.

### 2013 - Formula SAE Brasil (40 teams):

In my first year of participation on the Formula Student/SAE team, I was responsible for supporting the team with manual labor while learning how the project and the team work through the full year cycle.
