<!-- Andre is a young mechanical engineer that is currently shifting its career towards software development. He recently fell in love for the freedom that software development gives him to create. As a knowledge addict he would love to dive into an innovative project, where his creativity could be explored. His interests also ranges from Music Information Retreival and Visualization to the development of new Multimodal Interfaces using Signal Processing and Data Science techniques. -->
Curious, reactive, autodidact, versatile, I'm an engineer with competences in
web development. I'm currently looking for an internship in the domains related
to web development and data science. If you think I could be a good fit in your
team don't hesitate to contact me.
