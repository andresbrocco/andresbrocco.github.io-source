After a few researches on that topic, I realized that I would benefit from a visual tool to test its parameters and evaluate their influence.\nIn that occasion, I was studying web development, hence I decided to exercise my knowledge in a hands-on project. Take a look at the result !\n\n\u0026ldquo;The MCL algorithm is short for the Markov Cluster Algorithm, a fast and scalable unsupervised cluster algorithm for graphs (also known as networks) based on simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs.\u0026rdquo; - van Dongen, the author. Check the author\u0026rsquo;s page for more information.\nThe original method has only two parameters (Inflation and Prune Treshold):\n  The purpose of the inflation parameter is to reduce the connections across small communities - \u0026ldquo;rich get richer, poor get poorer\u0026rdquo;.\n  The prune treshold accelerates convergence by removing weak connections at each iteration.\n  The original algorithm has some known limitations: outputs many small clusters and does not scale well. To solve the first problem, Srinivas Parthasarathy proposed the \u0026lsquo;regularized segregation method\u0026rsquo; that allows more control over cluster sizes. He has also proposed solutions to enable the algorithm to scale better, but those were not considered in my project.\n","date":1590537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590537600,"objectID":"f532e6a8edb87449627463a6751d4b23","permalink":"https://andresbrocco.com/project/markovclusteringalgorithm/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/markovclusteringalgorithm/","section":"project","summary":"Interactive webpage to explore the influence of each parameter of the Markov Clustering Algorithm","tags":["JavaScript","Clustering","Markov","Web Development","Data Science"],"title":"Markov Clustering Algorithm","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Group \u0026lsquo;Perception, Action, and Interaction\u0026rsquo; at NICS explores the interaction between humans and digital media; \u0026lsquo;Perception\u0026rsquo; stands for audio analysis, psychoacoustics and visual cognition; \u0026lsquo;Action\u0026rsquo; stands for designing sound and visual arts; \u0026lsquo;Interaction\u0026rsquo; stands for how humans interfaces with the digital environment.

The presented work is a prototype of the first project of the group. The concept is to build an interactive imersive environment where a performer can navigate through a sphere full of silent movie clips and interact with them. The navigation is controlled by the users hands and position in the room, while other body features control video and audio effects.\nThe audio is also composed in real time using granular synthesis and mixing musical themes associated with each clip. This combination creates a noisy and thematic atmosphere that resembles an antique silent movie cinema. A shared space is created using the network, so that many actors can perform in real time, each one from its own machine. This process is documented at this publication.\n","date":1551225600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551225600,"objectID":"6ffa73be88dbc57e44f8bf5de46f2cfb","permalink":"https://andresbrocco.com/project/audiovisual-in-shared-space-as-a-metaphor-for-mindscapes/","publishdate":"2019-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/audiovisual-in-shared-space-as-a-metaphor-for-mindscapes/","section":"project","summary":"Prototype of Interactive art installation (P.A.I. group at the NICS laboratory).","tags":["Human-Computer Interface","Multimodal Interaction","Kinect","Java","Processing","Audio-Visual","Feature Extraction","Art Installation","Real time","Generative Art","Networked Performance","Collaborative Creation"],"title":"Audio-visuals in shared space as a metaphor for mindscapes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"ChromaJammer is personal project of a music visualization tool that \u0026ldquo;forces\u0026rdquo; synesthesia by associating colors with notes. The main goal is to assist the music learning process, by attaching vision and audition.\nThe ChromaJammer was written in the PureData programming language. The patch gets the audio from an external source (mic or music player) and analyses which notes are being played. Each note has an associated color. The color scheme was based on the circle of fifths, since it arranges the notes in an interesting manner: the interval between adjacent notes is the most consonant possible. The circle of fifths is drawn alongside a representation of a guitar arm. When a note is identified, its respective frets lights up on the guitar arm.\nAs an amateur musician, I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to improvise on the guitar, but struggled in learning music theory. On the other hand, I found myself with the right knowledge to develop a tool to enhance my capabilities. The project is open-source and can be downloaded from my GitHub repository. I hope more people enjoy the tool, and maybe some day I\u0026rsquo;ll go back to this project.\nI have made a video presenting the patch and showing it in action!\nYour browser does not support the video tag.

The algorithm developed by us analyses the music in real time to create synesthetic visual effects.\nThe installation was presented in a music festival: the audio from the DJ mixer was captured by an audio interface, and processed in a Pure Data patch. This patch simulated a fluid that was reacting to several audio features in real time.\nThe fluid positions were then mapped to a color palette, forming visual streams in a wave-like motion. Each particle of the fluid was then mapped to a corresponding Led in a strip.

After some experiments, I have found that the interaction with the fluid is negligible, and the only relevant characteristics were the geometry and material of the instrument.\nTherefore, the frequencies of the instruments notes can be determined by a simple modal analysis.
